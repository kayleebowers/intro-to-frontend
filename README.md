# Portfolio

## Project Description
My portfolio was built entirely out of HTML and custom CSS without the use of any libraries and with a sprinkle of JavaScript.

* Users can scroll through the portfolio content using the navigation bar at the top
* Users can learn about my coding background, see various projects, and contact me
