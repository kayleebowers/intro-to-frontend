      <p>Hi, I’m Kaylee! I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for stubbornly fighting my way through coding roadblocks and developing clean, efficient applications that are ready to make users’ lives a little easier.</p>
      <p>With a background in disaster relief, media, and education, I would have laughed if someone had told me that I would dive into the tech world just a few years ago. In fact, when a friend first asked me if I had ever considered getting into tech, I looked at her blankly and said, “No, never.”</p>
      <p>It took me months of researching and feeling offended by the mere existence of zero indexing before things started clicking, and I’ve been all in ever since. I earned my certifications in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures from freeCodeCamp and then took on CareerFoundry’s intensive Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp.</p>
      <p>Along the way, I rediscovered my enthusiasm for creative problem solving and analytical thinking, something my math-loving younger self has applauded at every step. I have always wanted a career that makes the time pass quickly, and I’ve discovered that and more as I have engineered fun JavaScript character apps, built RESTful APIs and MongoDB collections from scratch, designed single page applications with React, and implemented test- and behavior-driven development in a progressive web app.</p>
      <p>Nowadays when people ask me about tech, I can confidently say I love the challenges and endless learning opportunities it brings. I love the way I can take a blank code editor and transform it into a responsive website or an interactive application. Working with computers and programming languages may be inherently analytical, but it’s also a bit of real-life magic—only in this case, the magic words are phrases like “console.log,” “npm run start,” and “Google, how do I…?”</p>
      <p>I am currently searching for full-time opportunities to continue pursuing my newfound passion and putting my technical skills to good use. Check out some of my projects, and let me know if you are interested in learning more about how I can contribute to your project or team!</p>
